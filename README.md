## Security Notice

This tool sends your `.p12`, `.mobileprovision`, and password directly to [ipasign.cc](https://sign.ipasign.cc) in order to sign your IPA ‚Äî this is required for the signing process to work. No certificate files are stored or uploaded anywhere else.

When using the **"Send to Phone"** or **QR Code** features:
- The certificate **import link is encrypted client-side** using AES before being uploaded as temporary storage (deleted after one hour) to [Catbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe).
- The decryption password is only shared via the URL fragment (not stored anywhere).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should **only use this tool if you trust ipasign.cc** with your signing credentials. As with any third-party service handling Apple certificates, there is an inherent security risk.

---

## Development

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
- The signing API is called at `https://ipa.ipasign.cc/sign`.
- Polling status is checked at `https://ipa.ipasign.cc/status/{task_id}`.
- The latest IPA is fetched from the [Feather GitHub Releases](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/latest).
